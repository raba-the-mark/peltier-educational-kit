# peltier-didactic-kit
In this repository I present a device kit that can be used for control education. The kit is made by simple components so that it can be easily replicated at a low cost. It allows to test control algorithms


## Overview
The kit consists of two main components: the interface circuits and the Peltier cell (process).

*Figure 1: Operating principle of the Peltier kit.*

illustrates the operating principle of the kit. The Peltier cell is housed in a 3D-printed case. Inside the case, in addition to the cell, there are two fans, a power resistor, and two temperature sensors (one digital and one analog). One of the two fans, aided by a heat sink, is used to keep the uncontrolled side of the cell cool. This fan is always on. The other fan can be conveniently used to apply a load disturbance on the controlled side of the cell. The power resistor introduces another source of disturbance on the load but it creates the opposite effect (the fan removes heat, while the resistor generates heat). To improve heat conduction between the cell, the sensors, and the resistor, a thin metal plate has been inserted.
