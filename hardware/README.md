# Hardware

This folder contains all the hardware-related files of the didactic Peltier kit, including:

- **Schematics** (`schematics/`): Electrical diagrams in PDF and PNG format.
- **PCB files** (`pcb/gerber/`): Manufacturing files in Gerber format.
- **BOM** (`bom/`): Bill of Materials listing all components required to build the interface circuit.

The hardware has been designed to be simple, low-cost, and easily reproducible for educational purposes.
